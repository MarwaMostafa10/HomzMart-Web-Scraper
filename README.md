# HomzMart-Web-Scraper
This Python script scrapes product data from HomzMartâ€™s furniture category (Beds) using Selenium. It automates the extraction of key product details such as name, material, size, color, price, and image link. The scraped data is then stored in both CSV and Excel formats for further analysis.
